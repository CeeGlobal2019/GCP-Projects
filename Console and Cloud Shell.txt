Create a bucket and verify in the Cloud Console
Open Cloud Shell again.

Use the gsutil command to create another bucket. Replace <BUCKET_NAME> with a globally unique name (you can append a 2 to the globally unique bucket name you used previously):

gsutil mb gs://<BUCKET_NAME>

Copy the file into one of the buckets you created earlier in the lab. Replace [MY_FILE] with the file you uploaded and [BUCKET_NAME] with one of your bucket names:

gsutil cp [MY_FILE] gs://[BUCKET_NAME]

If your filename has whitespaces, ensure to place single quotes around the filename. For example, gsutil cp ‘my file.txt' gs://[BUCKET_NAME]

You have uploaded a file to the Cloud Shell VM and copied it to a bucket.

Identify available regions:
gcloud compute regions list
Create an environment variable and replace [YOUR_REGION] with the region you selected in the previous step:

INFRACLASS_REGION=[YOUR_REGION]

Verify it with echo:

echo $INFRACLASS_REGION

Create a subdirectory for materials used in this class:

mkdir infraclass

Create a file called config in the infraclass directory:

touch infraclass/config

Append the value of your Region environment variable to the config file:

echo INFRACLASS_REGION=$INFRACLASS_REGION >> ~/infraclass/config
